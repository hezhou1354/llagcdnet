Description: A generalized coordinate descent (GCD) algorithm for computing the 
    solution path of the LASSO and elastic net (adaptive) penalized least 
    squares, logistic regression, HHSVM, squared hinge loss SVM, expectile regression 
    and probit regression. 
             The local linear approximation (LLA) algorithm along with the generalized 
    coordinate descent (GCD) algorithm for computing the solution path of the folded 
    concave (SCAD) penalized least squares, logistic regression, HHSVM, squared hinge 
    loss SVM, expectile regression and probit regression.
